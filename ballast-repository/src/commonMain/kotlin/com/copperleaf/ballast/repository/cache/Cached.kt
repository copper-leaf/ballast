/**
 * A wrapper type designed to be stored within a Repository ViewModel and observed as a Flow in a Fragment ViewModel,
 * for fetching data from a remote source and caching it in memory. When data is refreshed, the previous values are kept
 * around for a nicer user experience, so the entire screen's data does not get cleared and re-populated causing
 * unwanted "jank" in the UI.
 *
 * Cached values should only be updated from a Repository. Typically, a UI ViewModel will observe a specific Cached
 * value, and the act of observing it requests the Repository start loading it. The UI ViewModel is then just a passive
 * observer of the state of the Cached value, which encapsulates all the data needed to decide when to show progress
 * loaders or success/error states of that value. When a UI ViewModel observes a Cached value, it should not need any
 * additional bookkeeping.
