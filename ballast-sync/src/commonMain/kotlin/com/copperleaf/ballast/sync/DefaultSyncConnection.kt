/**
 * The default connection implementation. This connection requires a single "Source" ViewModel, and new ViewModels that
 * start up as "Source" will cancel the previous one and take over that responsibility. It may have an unlimited number
 * of replicas or spectators.
 *
 * This connection uses a pluggable adapter, which handle the actual responsibility of dispatching States/Inputs to
 * the other ViewModels. You can use [InMemorySyncAdapter] to share those values directly in memory with no
 * serialization required, or you can create a custom adapter to serialize these values and share in some other way,
 * such as over a network.
