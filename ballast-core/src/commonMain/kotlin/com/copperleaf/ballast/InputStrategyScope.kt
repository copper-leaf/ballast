/**
 * Ballast ViewModels are designed to be safe and prevent you from doing things that could cause hard-to-debug race
 * conditions and break the purity of the MVI "state machine". But there are several ways to do this safely, though each
 * has their own set of pros/cons. By providing a different InputStrategy to your Ballast ViewModels, you can choose
 * which set of tradeoffs you are willing to accept, or you can define your own strategy customized to your needs.
 *
 * See the following links for the available core input strategies. By default, [LifoInputStrategy], which is suitable
 * for UI-bound ViewModels.
 *
 * @see [LifoInputStrategy]
 * @see [FifoInputStrategy]
 * @see [ParallelInputStrategy]
