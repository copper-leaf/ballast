The ScoreKeeper is a more complex version of a simple counter. It allows one to add/remove names from a list, and 
change the score of each player individually. 

How to use:

- Use the form field to enter one or more player names. Names must be unique. Players can be removed from the game by
  clicking the "X" button on their card.
- Click on a player card to select or deselect that player. Hit the numbered buttons below the list to increase/decrease 
  the score of all selected players' scores by that amount. 
- Scores are set temporarily to help you see how much you are adding in a single "move". After 5 seconds, the temporary
  scores will be "committed" and their total values updated accordingly. Alternatively, you may click on an individual
  player's score to commit it immediately.
- Player scores will be saved to your browser's LocalStorage with every change, and restored when reloading this page
  using the [Saved State module][1]
