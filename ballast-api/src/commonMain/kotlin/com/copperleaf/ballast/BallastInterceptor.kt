     * This is the main entry-point to Interceptor processing, and is the only callback directly called by the Ballast
     * framework. This callback should be overriden for more complex Interceptors that need to launch their own
     * coroutines, or that need to communicate back with the ViewModel by sending [Queued] objects back to the VM's
     * main queue.
     *
     * [BallastInterceptorScope] contains [CoroutineScope] that is tied to the ViewModel's main scope, so any jobs
     * launched here will be cancelled when the VM itself is cancelled. Interceptors may also need to launch into
     * another, more global [CoroutineScope] to collect the Notifications. In that case, the [notifications] Flow will
     * be terminated automatically after sending [BallastNotification.ViewModelCleared], which would then complete that
     * job at the appropriate time. Coroutines launched here must be launched with [CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED] to
     * guarantee that they will start collecting from [notifications] before any Notifications are actually sent from
     * the ViewModel, so that none of them are ever dropped from the Interceptor.
     *
     * When running, the Interceptor may post [Queued] objects back to the VM's main queue. This would be useful for
     * sending Inputs back to be processed, or forcibly updating the state without going through an Input.
     *
     * Use this snippet to get started:
     *
     * ```
     * override fun BallastInterceptorScope<Inputs, Events, State>.start(
     *     notifications: Flow<BallastNotification<Inputs, Events, State>>,
     * ) {
     *     launch(start = CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED) {
     *         notifications.awaitViewModelStart()
     *         notifications
     *             .onEach { handleInput(it) }
     *             .collect()
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
